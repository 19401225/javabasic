The INFP at Work

At work, the INFP is not particularly driven by money or status, 
preferring work that aligns with their personal values and allows them to help others. 
INFPs are typically motivated by vision and inspiration, and want to engage 
with projects and causes that feel important to them.

INFPs enjoy the process of creative problem-solving, and want to understand 
complex issues. They appreciate innovation, and want to come up with original ideas 
to improve circumstances for people. An ideal job for a Healer allows them to express 
their individuality in the way they work, and takes advantage of their ability to see 
unique solutions.

INFPs enjoy working autonomously and having control over how and when to complete 
a project. They often enjoy participating in teams, although they want to be free 
to put their own personal stamp on their work. When they do work with other people, 
it's important to the INFP that they be cooperative, supportive, and flexible,
and that they have similar passion for their ideals.



Top Careers for the INFP

Caring, creative INFPs tend to choose careers that let them express 
their individuality and their personal values. Many INFPs work in helping professions, 
where they can bring their compassion and empathy to others. INFPs also frequently 
choose to work in creative and artistic occupations which allow them to think freely 
and be their unique selves.




INFP Careers to Avoid

It is important to note that any personality type can be successful in any occupation. 
However, some occupations are well suited to the natural talents and preferred 
work style of the INFP, while other occupations demand modes of thinking 
and behavior that do not come as naturally to this type. Occupations that require 
the INFP to operate outside their natural preferences may prove stressful or draining, 
and often sound unappealing to INFPs who are choosing a career.

The following occupations have been found to be unpopular among INFPs, 
based on data gathered from surveys of the general population.



The INFP on a Team

INFPs are supportive and imaginative team members who contribute by understanding 
the ideals of their teammates and working to bring unity to the group’s mission. 
They listen openly to many points of view, and are talented at coming up 
with creative solutions that incorporate the ideas and priorities of everyone involved. 
They are flexible and innovate thinkers, and are willing to consider almost any option, 
so long as it is congruent with their values.

INFPs do best on a team that is guided by vision, and want to have 
an authentic understanding of the team’s purpose. They want to have team members 
who are similarly committed to a cause, and who are willing to explore 
the possibilities for achieving their ideals. Teams which are highly oriented to action,
without considering the deeper issues or the alternative options, may alienate the INFP. 
INFPs want an environment of mutual support and acceptance, and may have trouble 
on teams where there is much conflict or competition. Judgment and negativity tend 
to stifle their talent for creative problem-solving.




The INFP as a Leader

In leadership positions, INFPs motivate others through encouragement and positive vision. 
They are deeply idealistic, and when working for a cause that is important to them, 
they bring a quiet determination to their leadership role. They often see the potential 
in other people, and are good at inspiring others to use their gifts.

INFPs are supportive, creative leaders who encourage their teams to think outside 
the box. Because of their flexible nature and strong desire for harmony, 
they may avoid conflict and delay making difficult decisions. 
They do best leading cooperative teams of like-minded people who are similarly 
committed to their vision.
